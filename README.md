# 📸 Flutter Image Labeling App

A Flutter app that detects and labels objects in images using **Google ML Kit**.  
Users can either **capture** an image using their camera or **select** one from the gallery, and the app will analyze the image and display object labels with confidence scores.

It provides an intuitive UI where users can:
- **Take a picture** with the camera or **choose an image** from the gallery.
